## Accessibility Statement

<cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite> is a multi-format publication. We plan to make each issue available on the web, as an ebook, and in print.

We want our website and our ebooks to work well for people with disabilities and people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers. We aim for our website to conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) Level AA and for our ebooks to conform to [EPUB Accessibility 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/) - WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

If you come across accessibility or usability issues on the website, in an ebook, or in print, please let us know. You can email Cam at cam@apostropheampersand.art.

We have made PDFs of the print version available on our website for those who may want to print their own copies. Please note that those files are scanned and untagged PDFs and are not digitally accessible. The print versions are artfully designed but do not contain any unique content. For accessible digital versions, please view the website or ebook.
