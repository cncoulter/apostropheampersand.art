<p>It is our joy and privilege to welcome you to the inaugural issue of <cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite>, a grassroots, free-range literary magazine (a zine!) that's an excuse to make art and celebrate our friends' creative talents. We're dedicated to community, the written word, visual art, thoughtful design, and careful production. Think of this as a playful crossover between a seriously produced literary magazine and a punk zine.</p>

<p><cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite> is a themed publication, and for our first issue, it felt appropriate to choose the theme “Firsts.” Here, you'll find a first dog, and you'll visit a first day of college. We'll spotlight the first time “you” come across representation of a particular and important sort. We'll review instructions for falling in love, and we'll also sit with a more sorrowful first: the first time a parent is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Throughout this issue, you'll find poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, photography, and digital illustration. What a wonderful spread!</p>

<p><cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite> is a unique publication, dedicated not just to community in general but to <em>our community</em> specifically. We do not intend to open up this zine to general submissions from the public. Rather, we have solicited the pieces here in issue one from our friends, and in the future we intend to welcome contributions from our friends, friends of friends, and community members we personally know. Are you a word nerd who loved your high school literary magazine? We're aiming to recapture and channel some of that magic, that special something that comes with understanding that art is something everyone in the community can make and with seeing the work of people you personally know get lifted up.</p>

<p>Want to get involved but don't personally know the founders or contributors of this zine? Come introduce yourself next time we're at an open mic together! Or, start your own zine for your own community! This is a golden age for making and sharing art if you want it to be — and we do! We hope this project can inspire others to foster some indiepunk energy and to get out there making and sharing more art with their community.</p>

<p><cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite> exists not only because we wanted to solicit and spotlight the good work of our creative friends, it also exists because we like to edit and publish. We enjoy developmental edits and copyedits. We find joy designing both print and digital formats. We loved getting to build an accessible, responsive website that isn&rsquo;t enshittified like so much of the Internet these days. We loved {something specific to Danae about editing/design/publishing}. It can be simple enough to write, photograph, or draw as a hobby, but it can be trickier to edit and publish as a hobby, simply because you need to first source something to edit and publish. This zine is our scheme to practice our editorial and production hobbycrafts, and we have sincerely enjoyed it thus far.</p>

<p>To that end, we wish to thank the contributors to this inaugural issue for trusting us with your art. We not only loved getting to see your work — we loved getting to play with it, to have the opportunity to produce and share it. Thank you for the privilege and the treat, and thank you for your patience and grace as we worked out the initial complexities and challenges that come along with the first issue of a publication. We love you.</p>
