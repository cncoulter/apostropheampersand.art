<p>Welcome to the inaugural issue of <cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite>, a grassroots literary magazine (a zine!) that's an excuse to make art and celebrate our friends’ creative talents. <cite>AnA</cite> began as a late-night “what if.” What if we found a way to combine our dedication to community-building with our appreciation for all things art? What if we found a way to do production as a hobby? What if we started our own publication that was a playful crossover between a seriously produced literary magazine and a hand-crafted indie punk zine? And what if its name was a cheeky homage to a love for alliteration, punctuation, and well-chosen fonts?</p>

<p><cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite> is a themed publication. For our first issue, it felt appropriately on-the-nose to choose the theme of “Firsts.” Here, you'll find a range of experiences, from a first dog to a first day of college. We’ll spotlight the first time “you” encounter representation of a particular and important sort. We’ll review instructions for falling in love, and we’ll sit with a more sorrowful first: the first time a parent is diagnosed with a terminal illness. And we’ll look at how firsts fit into a cycle of beginnings born from endings. Throughout this issue, you’ll find poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, photography, and digital illustration. What a wonderful spread!</p>

<p>All the pieces in this issue were solicited from within our community. <cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand</cite> is, at its core, a niche project meant to highlight the cool things being made by all the cool people we know and inspire them to make even more cool things. We also hope that our community itself might grow—that this zine gets shared with folks outside our immediate circle and that those folks reach out to get connected. For us, art is not the end goal, but rather the first step in building bridges.</p>

<p>Want to get involved but don’t personally know the founders or contributors of this zine? Come introduce yourself next time we’re at an open mic together! Or, start your own zine for your own community! This is a golden age for making and sharing art if you want it to be—and we do! We hope this project can inspire others to foster some indiepunk energy and to get out there making and sharing more art with their community.</p>

<p>To that end, we wish to thank the contributors to this inaugural issue for trusting us with your art. We not only loved getting to see your work—we loved getting to play with it, to have the opportunity to produce and share it. Thank you for the privilege and the treat, and thank you for your patience and grace as we worked out the initial complexities and challenges that come along with the first issue of a publication. We love you, we see you, and we hope you enjoy <cite>Apostrophe and Ampersand: Firsts</cite>.</p>

<p>Cheers!<br>Cam &amp; Danae</p>
