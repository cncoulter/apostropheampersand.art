<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; by Ball Park Music on repeat. It could have been written about my life. How it felt to accompany my dad in the last year of his life; to hold him as he died of ALS. How it feels to know I&rsquo;ll probably die the same way in 15-30 years. How it feels to throw myself into preventing this terminal neurodegenerative genetic disease in my own life.</p>

<p>Remember that on the day my dad was diagnosed, I wore a yellow shirt to accompany him to appointments? I thought no matter the results, somehow everything would be OK if I wore a happy yellow. He died a year later.</p>

<p><cite>True terror in the middle of the&mdash;</cite></p>

<p>Remember when we were new to rotating my dad at night? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, but can I ask you to rotate me? I can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he called to us for the fifth time that night. That was sadness and torn pride in his voice. After a lifetime of easy sleep, he had just lost the ability to rotate himself comfortably. For the rest of his life.</p>

<p><cite>I&rsquo;m a shotgun full of pain&mdash;</cite></p>

<p>Remember that first night? I sobbed next to you, muffling my cries so Dad couldn&rsquo;t hear me through the cracked doorway. I felt guilty that I could still rotate and that he never would again. I felt terrified, recognizing the near certainty that this was my future. That&rsquo;s the moment I decided that I&rsquo;ll fight with all I&rsquo;ve got until then.</p>

<p><cite>So surrender, so surrender&mdash;</cite></p>

<p>But when ALS hits <em>me</em>, I&rsquo;m choosing the end date myself. I can&rsquo;t live like that. I&rsquo;m not strong enough.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know yet what &ldquo;give in if it makes you feel better&rdquo; looks like. Maybe I have nothing left to give or, on some days, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the chance to feel better.</p>

<p>For now, I still allow myself the belief that a yellow blouse can buffer the terror and pain of the worst days of my life, surprising myself with the unreality that it somehow does.</p>
