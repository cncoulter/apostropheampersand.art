<p>Even in death there was color. The trees, white. The dirt, blackened soot. A gray, gloomy sky with textured puffs of cloud overlapping like too many blankets on an unmade bed. To common eyes ignoring that white is all colors and black both the absence and a color in itself, there was naught by dreary monochrome. They exiled the landscape to vague memory, and it lived as a dying relic.</p>

<p>But war did not take all. When the fireworks display of flung curses snuffed out at the final toll, the rich red blood soaked deep into the tapestry of the newly-stained earth. (Black is not always the absence.) In some days, a pale pearlescent pink wriggles underground, feasting, birthing, dying, feasting. In weeks, blue visits on the wings of a passing bird. In months, a mottled brown brings a bit of warmth, as burrowed critters emerge from their out-of-season hibernation. In a year, a golden gleam&mdash;the eyes of roaming beasts who stalk the space between rotting ancient trees. They pad on the fresh green of hungry moss and young grass. (Even a curse cannot stop the relentless march of time.)</p>

<p>The people have forgotten. Tragedy is best left in the past. But the fungus remembers. And it marks the graves of the dead and the scars on the land. It paves a path of danger and safety. It signals the places to escape. (Be careful where you escape to.) And the fungus knows when curious minds can&rsquo;t resist the call. It welcomes her, shows her the work that&rsquo;s been done, the progress that&rsquo;s been made, the stuff still left to do.</p>

<p>If she stays, she will never finish. She will die here and join the ghostly chorus. She will toil the endless toil, a lonely little thing with no renown or reward. But if she stays, they will feel her love. They will see her effort, read her notes, sleep in her home, travel her paths. They will know what she worked for, and they will take up her mantle. They will also die. But the next will follow, and the next, and the next. And one day, a young mage will wake up, their lips ready to dispel the minor curses that settled with the fog, and they will feel that today is different.</p>

<p>The crowded clouds part. The trees turn to watch. The birds freeze. The beasts hold their breath. A single stream of light breaks through the gloom, and for a moment the world glimmers and the fungus sings. The mage beams, and the work begins.</p>
