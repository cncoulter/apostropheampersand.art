<p>Watching him die of ALS the same way I will was the most painful
thing I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>You see, I inherited the most common genetic cause of Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) from him.
Every missed step, every lost gesture, every night repositioning him
multiple times an hour. The agony in his eyes when he couldn’t breathe,
yet blamed it on a mispositioned face mask. Progression to death in 14
months, faster than we could have imagined. In his eyes—our shared hazel
eyes—I saw my future laid out before me.</p>
<p>I’ve said I’m trying to cure ALS to save my family, but that’s only
half the truth. I’m trying to cure ALS before it gets me.</p>
<p>I didn’t make the rules, I had to learn them. I exist within a sick
numbers game, a hidden timer started the day I was born. Heads: 50%
chance it hits in 20 years, like my aunt. Tails: 95% in 30, like my dad.
I’m trying to outrun the clock while waiting for the shoe to drop. I’m
trying to <em>prevent</em> C9orf72 ALS and FTD in my own life before these
diseases make it impossible to have a fruitful career as a
physician-scientist. Earlier this year, I decided that instead of
leveraging my career to target other incurable diseases, I would start
by trying to survive.</p>
<p>I miss my dad every single day. His exuberant predisposition. Our
intertwined hands. Our last full-bodied hug. What makes his loss more
devastating on the first anniversary of his death is knowing the story
of ALS in my family doesn’t end here. It’ll repeat in my generation and
those that follow unless we do something about it.</p>
<p>This isn’t the path I would have chosen, but it’s the path I’ve been
given.</p>
<p>I wrote about this journey anonymously earlier this year. In that
process, I decided to stop trying to outrun my genetic predisposition to
ALS &amp; FTD, and turn around to meet it head-on. In 6 months, I’ve
given samples to 3 ALS/FTD clinical trials, attended 6 neurodegeneration
conferences, had 50+ meetings with experts, and developed 6 C9 projects
to this end.</p>
<p>“Will you help me cure myself?” or “You’ve tried this in Alzheimer’s,
but have you considered ALS?” or “How can I help you achieve ⸻ in the
ALS/FTD space?” Being direct is my secret weapon. It’s not about
publications, awards, or prestige. All hands on deck—I win by surviving.
And I’ll bring 200,000+ patients with me.</p>
<p>I’m in battle mode, but I can’t do it alone. If you’re fighting
ALS/FTD in any capacity—in the lab, in the clinic, in the boardroom,
through philanthropy, in your own life or in your family—let’s talk.
There are innumerable ways to join the fight for survival.</p>
