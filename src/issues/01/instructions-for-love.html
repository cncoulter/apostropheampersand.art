<h2>Step One</h2>

<p>Start slowly. Leaning into the discomfort with raging yearning desirous passion is not
necessarily advised. For short-term fires that burn as fast and hot and bright as
magnesium, jumping in to someone’s heart full force may be the best option. However,
if presented with the possibility of failure or a potential lack of interest, the waters must
be tested. The rejection isn’t really the worst part of it—it’s the embarrassment of having
read the situation wrong, of imposing your own desire onto your entire perception of the
situation. So start slowly and listen, listen to everything she has to say. Listen to the
words she has for you, and maybe try not to think about them too much at the time and
instead remember them for later when you’re alone and can obsess over them properly.
Then again, detachment from the situation is also imperative. Basically, the initial stage
contains the largest margin for error due to lack of knowledge of the other person (this
statement will seem silly and ridiculous once later stages are reached).</p>

<h2>Step Two</h2>

<p>So now you’ve found it. You’ve found all the answers and you can give yourself a self-congratulatory handjob or take up a new sport, like smoking cigarettes. [this is total shit]</p>
