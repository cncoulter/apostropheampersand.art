<p>For as long as I can remember, you have never been anyone but yourself<br>
Just a girl, eyes bright and head strong<br>
Your voice hasn&rsquo;t always been the loudest and your face has never been the prettiest<br>
And that&rsquo;s always been okay with you, mostly because you never noticed.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, you have never known what you wanted to be<br>
Maybe you&rsquo;re just a girl, eyes wandering and head full<br>
Your dreams will always be far-off and your thoughts will never shut off<br>
But that&rsquo;s always been okay with you, because maybe one day it will all pay off.</p>

<p>I used to think that the answer to &ldquo;Am I going to change?&rdquo; was my biggest fear<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe in genies or fairy godmothers (You shouldn&rsquo;t either)<br>
So don&rsquo;t waste your time on magical wishes,<br>
especially the kind that look like your first college kiss<br>
because he won&rsquo;t answer your wishes or even your text messages.</p>

<p>I thought I was trying to be someone who was interesting&mdash;<br>
someone who had too many journals for my dorm room<br>
but not enough to hold everything in my head or my heart;<br>
someone whose laugh could twinkle and shine<br>
but whose tears could smear and stain<br>
because those journals, twinkles, and smears could say more about me than my voice ever will.</p>

<p>You think so much about what others think of you&mdash;<br>
judging you because of your major, your public high school, and the color of your skin<br>
But pay them nothing but a side glance and a gracious smile<br>
and don&rsquo;t let them know that you are on your way to something more.</p>

<p>You feel like the world is your oyster, waiting for you to fly<br>
Nothing can stop you, not the wet socks the dryer in your dorm produces<br>
and not the paper that will keep you up until 3 in the morning.<br>
Just return the lost ID card you found and<br>
keep the door open for the person behind you.</p>

<p>Four years from now, you will have learned textbooks and handouts on theories, histories, and methods<br>
and you will have realized so many things you need to know about taking care of yourself<br>
You will have been to your first party, turned in your last final, &amp; eaten your favorite pizza time and time again</p>

<p>Four years later, I know now that you were always that someone interesting<br>
Eyes bright and wandering, head strong and full<br>
A girl afraid of changing, because flowers can always lose petals too<br>
but I want you to know that maybe we don&rsquo;t so much as change as<br>
become more of who we are meant to be</p>
