<div class="poem">

<p>
<span class="line">For as long as I can remember, you have never been anyone but yourself</span>
<span class="line">Just a girl, eyes bright and head strong</span>
<span class="line">Your voice hasn&rsquo;t always been the loudest and your face has never been the prettiest</span>
<span class="line">And that&rsquo;s always been okay with you, mostly because you never noticed.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">For as long as I can remember, you have never known what you wanted to be</span>
<span class="line">Maybe you&rsquo;re just a girl, eyes wandering and head full</span>
<span class="line">Your dreams will always be far-off and your thoughts will never shut off</span>
<span class="line">But that&rsquo;s always been okay with you, because maybe one day it will all pay off.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">I used to think that the answer to &ldquo;Am I going to change?&rdquo; was my biggest fear</span>
<span class="line">I don&rsquo;t believe in genies or fairy godmothers (You shouldn&rsquo;t either)</span>
<span class="line">So don&rsquo;t waste your time on magical wishes,</span>
<span class="line">especially the kind that look like your first college kiss</span>
<span class="line">because he won&rsquo;t answer your wishes or even your text messages.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">I thought I was trying to be someone who was interesting&mdash;</span>
<span class="line">someone who had too many journals for my dorm room</span>
<span class="line">but not enough to hold everything in my head or my heart;</span>
<span class="line">someone whose laugh could twinkle and shine</span>
<span class="line">but whose tears could smear and stain</span>
<span class="line">because those journals, twinkles, and smears could say more about me than my voice ever will.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You think so much about what others think of you&mdash;</span>
<span class="line">judging you because of your major, your public high school, and the color of your skin</span>
<span class="line">But pay them nothing but a side glance and a gracious smile</span>
<span class="line">and don&rsquo;t let them know that you are on your way to something more.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You feel like the world is your oyster, waiting for you to fly</span>
<span class="line">Nothing can stop you, not the wet socks the dryer in your dorm produces</span>
<span class="line">and not the paper that will keep you up until 3 in the morning.</span>
<span class="line">Just return the lost ID card you found and</span>
<span class="line">keep the door open for the person behind you.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">Four years from now, you will have learned textbooks and handouts on theories, histories, and methods</span>
<span class="line">and you will have realized so many things you need to know about taking care of yourself</span>
<span class="line">You will have been to your first party, turned in your last final, &amp; eaten your favorite pizza time and time again</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">Four years later, I know now that you were always that someone interesting</span>
<span class="line">Eyes bright and wandering, head strong and full</span>
<span class="line">A girl afraid of changing, because flowers can always lose petals too</span>
<span class="line">but I want you to know that maybe we don&rsquo;t so much as change as</span>
<span class="line">become more of who we are meant to be</span>
</p>
