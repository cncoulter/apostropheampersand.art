<p>The first time you really think<br>
about the importance of representation<br>
you&rsquo;re in college, studying feminism.<br>
You still think of yourself as a man.<br>
You don&rsquo;t think you have other options,<br>
ways out<br>
of being your own cop, judge, and jailer.</p>

<p>You think diverse, positive representations of all people&mdash;<br>
both in this lived reality<br>
and in our imagined worlds&mdash;<br>
is a vital way<br>
to expand the sphere of possibility,<br>
to uplift and help liberate<br>
<em>those people,</em><br>
marginalized people,<br>
people not like you.<br>
You get the idea, in principle.</p>

<p>The second time you really think<br>
about the importance of representation<br>
is a few years later.<br>
You&rsquo;re in Kansas, which may be<br>
the least diverse place you&rsquo;ve ever lived,<br>
but you have a lot of free time.<br>
You read a lot of science fiction and fantasy.<br>
Notably, you read a lot of short fiction,<br>
the bleeding edge of the genre.</p>

<p>You notice there&rsquo;s something different about these stories.<br>
For the first time in your life,<br>
you come across consistent, good representation<br>
of trans people, nonbinary people, agender people, genderfluid people,<br>
people for whom gender doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,<br>
society that do not respect the gender binary.<br>
This expands the sphere of possibilities<br>
that you can imagine for yourself.<br>
You think back to your inherited assumptions,<br>
and begin to imagine alternatives.</p>

<p>You ask yourself:<br>
<i>Am I trans? How would I know?</i><br>
And you realize that you want the answer to be:<br>
<em>Yes. Yes.</em></p>

<p>You ask yourself:<br>
<i>Is it really allowed? Is it really so simple?</i><br>
And for the first time<br>
you can imagine the answer is:<br>
<em>Yes.<br>
Yes it is.<br>
Yes you are<br>
trans nonbinary agender beautiful and free.</em></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t just unlock your jail-cell door&mdash;<br>
you fucking walk straight through it<br>
like a superhero tapping into a power greater than yourself,<br>
phase-shifting into a realm where freedom is possible,<br>
where you fit in your own damn skin.</p>

<p>Through your own lived experience now,<br>
you get the idea.</p>
