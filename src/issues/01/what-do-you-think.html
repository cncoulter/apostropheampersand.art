<div class="poem">

<p>
<span class="line">The first time you really think</span>
<span class="line">about the importance of representation</span>
<span class="line">you’re in college, studying feminism.</span>
<span class="line">You still think of yourself as a man.</span>
<span class="line">You don’t think you have other options,</span>
<span class="line">ways out</span>
<span class="line">of being your own cop, judge, and jailer.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You think diverse, positive representations of all people—</span>
<span class="line">both in this lived reality</span>
<span class="line">and in our imagined worlds—</span>
<span class="line">is a vital way</span>
<span class="line">to expand the sphere of possibility,</span>
<span class="line">to uplift and help liberate</span>
<span class="line"><em>those people,</em></span>
<span class="line">marginalized people,</span>
<span class="line">people not like you.</span>
<span class="line">You get the idea, in principle.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">The second time you really think</span>
<span class="line">about the importance of representation</span>
<span class="line">is a few years later.</span>
<span class="line">You’re in Kansas, which may be</span>
<span class="line">the least diverse place you’ve ever lived,</span>
<span class="line">but you have a lot of free time.</span>
<span class="line">You read a lot of science fiction and fantasy.</span>
<span class="line">Notably, you read a lot of short fiction,</span>
<span class="line">the bleeding edge of the genre.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You notice there’s something different about these stories.</span>
<span class="line">For the first time in your life,</span>
<span class="line">you come across consistent, good representation</span>
<span class="line">of trans people, nonbinary people, agender people, genderfluid people,</span>
<span class="line">people for whom gender doesn’t make any sense,</span>
<span class="line">societies that do not respect the gender binary.</span>
<span class="line">This expands the sphere of possibilities</span>
<span class="line">that you can imagine for yourself.</span>
<span class="line">You think back to your inherited assumptions,</span>
<span class="line">and begin to imagine alternatives.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You ask yourself:</span>
<span class="line"><i>Am I trans? How would I know?</i></span>
<span class="line">And you realize that you want the answer to be:</span>
<span class="line"><em>Yes. Yes.</em></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You ask yourself:</span>
<span class="line"><i>Is it really allowed? Is it really so simple?</i></span>
<span class="line">And for the first time</span>
<span class="line">you can imagine the answer is:</span>
<span class="line"><em>Yes.</em></span>
<span class="line"><em>Yes it is.</em></span>
<span class="line"><em>Yes you are</em></span>
<span class="line"><em>trans nonbinary agender beautiful and free.</em></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">You don’t just unlock your jail-cell door—</span>
<span class="line">you fucking walk straight through it</span>
<span class="line">like a superhero tapping into a power greater than yourself,</span>
<span class="line">phase-shifting into a realm where freedom is possible,</span>
<span class="line">where you fit in your own damn skin.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="line">Through your own lived experience now,</span>
<span class="line">you get the idea.</span>
</p>
