<p>Danae Stahlnecker writes, edits, crafts, and designs professionally and avocationally. She's done a lot of things. She wants to do even more. Ask her about teaching, style guides, anime & manga, D&D, sewing, faith, and the best places to get pizza in the South Bay while you plot how to make the world better. You can find traces of her existence at Common Sense Media, Content Magazine, and this very zine.</p>
