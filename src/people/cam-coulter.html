They write about science fiction and fantasy for <cite>Skiffy and Fanty</cite>, and they blog about social justice, simple living, community, and spirituality at <cite>The Ruined Report</cite>. Their poetry has appeared in <cite>Eternal Haunted Summer</cite>, <cite>Eye to the Telescope</cite>, and <cite>Polu Texni</cite>.</p>
