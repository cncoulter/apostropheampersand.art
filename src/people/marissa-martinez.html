<p>Marissa Martinez loves pointing out how nice the clouds and flowers look outside and then trying to replicate that niceness in her writing and art. She is a playwright, poet, zine-maker, and arts advocate born and raised in East San José. As a biracial Leo/Libra/Aquarius girlie, she often thinks about her identity, how to amplify the voices of the global majority, and chocolate fudge ice cream. Marissa’s work has been featured by <cite>EASTSIDE Magazine</cite>, <cite>La Raíz Magazine</cite>, and <cite>Sampaguita Press</cite>.
